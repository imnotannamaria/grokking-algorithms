## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Running Examples
Each chapter contains standalone Python files that can be run directly:

```bash
# Example: Run binary search from Chapter 1
python chapter_01_introduction/binary_search.py
```
